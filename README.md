# TelegramChatbot

Hi, this is a simple python code to create a Telegram chatbot. Set up can be completed within 20 min~

Couple of things to take note of:

First, we need to create a bot in Telegram using BotFather. Refer to the screenshot below. Do remember the API key generated, and this API is required in config.cfg. Manually update the newly created API key at Token = ???.
